# discord-meeting-summarizer

This is a minimal, production‑ready template for a Discord bot that records daily voice meetings, transcribes them with Whisper, and summarizes into action items + decisions. It’s designed to be deployable on a small VM (Fly.io/Render/DigitalOcean) or Docker.

Made for my startup project, [PontiFi](https://pontifi.com/).
